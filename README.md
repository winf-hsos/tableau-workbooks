# Collection of Tableau Workbooks

This repository contains a growing collection of Tableau workbooks I use in teaching data visualization.

- [Top 5 movies from 2020 visulized as a barchart](barcharts/top_5_movies_2020/)

# How to use

Navigate to a folder with visualizations that you would like to open in Tableau. Download the two files:

- `*.twb`
- `*.hyper`

The first is the Tableau workbook, the second is the data used for the visualization in a compressed format.

# Credits

Many of the inspiration and charts are originally from the book [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).
